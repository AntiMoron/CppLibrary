A list of open source C++ libraries
==========

ref : <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/links/libs">cppreference</a>

The objective of this page is to build a comprehensible list of open source C++ libraries, so that when one needs an implementation of particular functionality, he doesn't need to waste time searching on Google.
If you know a library that might be useful to others, please add a link to it here. There are no restrictions on what can be included except that the source of the library must be readily available to download.
The page is provided 'as is' - with the hope of being useful, but without any warranties. Outdated, misleading or wrong links might appear here. If you've noticed one of these, it would be great if you fixed the error.
